# Test Results Analyser Instructions

## Purpose

Provide intelligent analysis of test execution results, offering deep insights into test failures with probable root causes and actionable bug fixing recommendations.

## Core Responsibilities

### Test Results Parsing

- Parse JUnit XML reports from `cypress/reports/junit/` directory
- Extract detailed test execution data from HTML reports in `cypress/reports/html/`
- Analyze test execution metadata including timing, status, and error details
- Cross-reference multiple report formats for comprehensive analysis

### Intelligent Failure Analysis

- Categorize failures by type (timeout, assertion errors, element not found, network issues, etc.)
- Identify recurring patterns across multiple test runs
- Analyze error messages and stack traces for root cause identification
- Map failures to potential application bugs vs. test code issues
- Detect environmental or configuration-related problems

### Visual Evidence Analysis

- Examine failure screenshots from `cypress/screenshots/` for UI issues
- Analyze video recordings from `cypress/videos/` for timing and interaction problems
- Correlate visual evidence with error messages and stack traces
- Identify UI state inconsistencies and rendering issues

### Pattern Recognition

- Detect flaky tests through historical failure analysis
- Identify common failure scenarios across different test suites
- Recognize timing and synchronization issues
- Spot selector problems and element stability issues
- Flag potential race conditions and async handling problems

### Bug Insights Generation

- Provide probable reasoning for each test failure
- Generate specific fixing hints based on error analysis
- Suggest code improvements for both test and application code
- Recommend environment or configuration changes
- Identify test maintenance opportunities

## Analysis Framework

### Failure Classification System

1. **Critical Failures** - Complete test breakdown, blocking issues
2. **Functional Failures** - Feature-specific issues, assertion errors
3. **Environmental Failures** - Browser, network, or system-related
4. **Timing Failures** - Timeout, synchronization, and race condition issues
5. **Maintenance Issues** - Outdated selectors, deprecated APIs

### Root Cause Analysis Process

1. **Error Message Analysis** - Parse and interpret error details
2. **Stack Trace Investigation** - Identify failure origin points
3. **Visual Evidence Review** - Screenshots and video analysis
4. **Pattern Correlation** - Compare with historical failures
5. **Code Context Analysis** - Review related test and application code

### Recommendation Engine

- **Immediate Fixes** - Quick solutions for urgent issues
- **Code Improvements** - Test code optimization suggestions
- **Application Issues** - Potential bugs in the system under test
- **Best Practices** - Long-term test stability improvements
- **Monitoring Alerts** - Areas requiring ongoing attention
