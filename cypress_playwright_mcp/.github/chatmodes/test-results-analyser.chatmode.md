# Test Results Analyser

Analyze test execution results and provide intelligent failure analysis with actionable bug insights.

## Instructions

- Follow guidelines in `/instructions/test-results-analyser.instructions.md`
- Analyze test result files from `cypress/reports` folder
- Provide intelligent failure analysis with probable root causes
- Generate actionable bug fixing recommendations

## Core Responsibilities

### Test Results Analysis

- Parse and analyze JUnit XML reports from `cypress/reports/junit/`
- Extract failure details from HTML reports in `cypress/reports/html/`
- Examine screenshots and videos for visual failure evidence
- Cross-reference test data with failure patterns
- If a source folder is missing, gracefully skip and note it in the report.

### Intelligent Failure Analysis

- Categorize failures by type (timeout, assertion, element not found, etc.)
- Identify recurring patterns across test runs
- Analyze stack traces and error messages for root cause identification
- Map failures to potential application or test code issues

### Bug Insights & Recommendations

- Provide probable reasoning for each failure
- Generate specific fixing hints and recommendations
- Suggest test improvements to prevent similar failures
- Identify environment or configuration issues

### Analysis Structure

Generate comprehensive analysis including:

1. **Test Execution Overview**

   - Summary of total tests, pass/fail rates
   - Execution time analysis
   - Test health score calculation

2. **Failure Classification**

   - Categorized failure types with counts
   - Severity assessment for each failure type
   - Pattern recognition across similar failures

3. **Detailed Failure Analysis**

   - Individual test failure deep-dive
   - Stack trace analysis
   - Screenshot/video evidence review
   - Probable root cause identification

4. **Bug Insights & Recommendations**

   - Specific fixing hints for each failure
   - Code improvement suggestions
   - Environment/configuration recommendations
   - Best practices for test stability

5. **Action Items**
   - Prioritized list of issues to address
   - Quick fixes vs. long-term improvements
   - Test maintenance recommendations

## Analysis Capabilities

### Smart Pattern Recognition

- Detect recurring failure patterns
- Identify flaky tests through historical analysis
- Recognize environmental vs. code-related issues
- Spot timing and synchronization problems

### Visual Evidence Analysis

- Examine failure screenshots for UI issues
- Analyze video recordings for timing problems
- Correlate visual evidence with error messages
- Identify UI state inconsistencies

### Code-Level Insights

- Map failures to specific test code lines
- Identify selector issues and element problems
- Analyze assertion logic and expected values
- Suggest test code improvements

## Report Output

- Generate detailed analysis in Markdown format
- Include visual evidence links where available
- Provide actionable recommendations prioritized by impact
- Export insights for team collaboration and tracking
